          <li><strong>Introduction<br></strong>This Service Agreement contains the terms and conditions (the “Terms”) that govern the Services. The Client shall only provide access to the Services (as defined below) to authorized representatives who will be deemed to be acting on behalf of the Client. In the Terms, “the Client”, &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; will collectively refer to the Client and its authorized representatives. Vrarify reserves the right to make non-material updates to this Agreement.</li>
          <li><strong>General description of the Services<br></strong>AI Engineering Subscription Plans: Vrarify provides premium on-demand and fully managed AI engineering services. Depending on the number of subscriptions you have with us that will determine the number of AI Engineering Managers and AI Engineers assigned to you.</li>
          <li><strong>Change of Plan, Upgrades and Downgrades<br></strong>The Client is entitled to upgrade the Plan during the Agreement Term. Downgrades and changes from one Plan to another Plan are only permitted from the next Agreement Term with a minimum thirty (30) days prior notice in writing. Such notices should be issued in writing to the AI Engineering Manager assigned to you. You are not allowed to pause a Plan. Notice to pause the Plan may be treated as notice of termination of such Plan. Changes that come into effect will continue to remain in effect for the following Agreement Term unless the notice explicitly states otherwise.</li>
          <li><strong>Term and Termination<br>A. </strong>This Agreement shall begin on the Start Date and, unless terminated earlier in accordance with these Terms, remain in effect for the duration of the Agreement Term.<br>B. Either party may terminate the Agreement in writing with immediate effect where:<br>    i. One party is in material breach of the Agreement (where the breach remains even after the party in breach has been given thirty (30) calendar days to cure after first receiving confirmed written notice of the breach);<br>    ii. The party not seeking termination is insolvent or undergoing liquidation proceedings; or<br>    iii. In accordance with section 34 Force Majeure (each of (i), (ii) and (iii) a “Termination for Cause”).<br>C. This Agreement automatically renews for a new Agreement Term unless terminated in accordance with this Agreement.<br>D. Where notice of termination is given in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of the next Agreement Term, the Plan will remain effective for the remainder of the current Agreement Term and subsequently be terminated at the end of the current Agreement Term. Where notice of termination is given less than thirty (30) days from the commencement of the next Agreement Term, the Plan will automatically renew and remain effective until the end of the next subsequent Agreement Term.</li>
          <li>‍<strong>Project Quality<br></strong>It is your responsibility to terminate a project if progress is not deemed satisfactory. The Client is liable in full for all hours worked regardless of satisfaction with the end product. It is the Client’s responsibility to inquire for progress reports sufficiently frequently to evaluate progress. In the event that the work is deemed unsatisfactory, it is your responsibility to report to Vrarify as soon as possible.</li>
          <li><strong>Pricing and Price Change<br></strong>Vrarify reserves the right to change the Services specifications, fees and the List Prices with thirty (30) calendar days written notice of such changes. Changes to the Services specifications and fee structure shall take effect from the commencement of the next Agreement Term which begins on or after the effective date of change. A change in List Price shall apply to all Projects started on or after the thirty (30) calendar day written notice and will take effect during your current Agreement Term.</li>
          <li><strong>Refunds<br>A. </strong>Except for Terminations for Cause by the Client, as specified in Section 5, or where the Client exercises the right to opt out when applicable, the Client is not entitled to a refund for remaining months nor unused credit or hours on termination<br>B. Any refund in connection with a Termination for Cause by the Client shall be prorated based on the remaining portion of the then-current Agreement Term Amount, less any Overage. In no event shall any refund for any reason whatsoever include past amounts paid.</li>
          <li>‍<strong>Payment<br></strong>The Agreement Term Amount will be automatically charged on the renewal date with the payment method on file, in accordance with the Billing Frequency, while this Agreement remains in effect.<br><br>Payment can be made with credit or debit card. The payment currency is USD. If any outstanding amount is more than thirty (30) days overdue from Payment Terms, Vrarify reserves the right to charge 1.5% interest per month on the outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection. Such outstanding amounts may be sent to a Debt Collection agency. You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with Services other than U.S. taxes based on Vrarify net income.<br><br>Vrarify reserves the right to put Services on hold or terminate the Agreement with immediate effect should any outstanding amount be more than thirty (5) days overdue. Where Services are put on hold due to overdue outstanding amounts, Vrarify shall be considered to be fulfilling the Service obligations in accordance with this Agreement and the Client will not be entitled to any relief for such action. Where the Agreement is terminated in accordance with this paragraph, the Client shall remain liable for all fees up until date of termination, plus any Overage fees incurred. The fees for the then-current Agreement Term Amount shall be prorated for the period up until date of such termination.</li>

          <li><strong>Enforcing Rights<br></strong>Either party’s failure or delay to exercise or enforce any right or claim does not constitute a waiver of such right or claim and will in no way affect the parties right to later enforce or exercise it, unless the party issues an express written waiver, signed by a duly authorized representative of the party.</li>

Subject to the foregoing restrictions, this Agreement will inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.</li>

The illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision in that jurisdiction will not in any way affect the legality, validity, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or of any other provision in any jurisdiction.</li>
          <li><strong>Force Majeure<br></strong>Except for your accrued payment obligations for Services already rendered under this Agreement, no party shall be liable or responsible to the other party, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this Agreement when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts beyond the affected party’s reasonable control, including without limitation: strikes, lock-outs or other industrial disputes (whether involving its own workforce or a third-party’s), trespassing, sabotage, theft or other criminal acts, cyber-attacks, failure of energy sources or transport network, acts of God, export bans, sanctions and other government actions, war, terrorism, riot, civil commotion, interference by civil or military authorities, national or international calamity, armed conflict, malicious damage, breakdown of plant or machinery, nuclear, chemical or biological contamination, explosions, collapse of building structures, fires, floods, storms, earthquakes, or similar events, natural disasters or extreme adverse weather conditions and excluding any viral or bacterial epidemic or pandemic (including COVID-19) (each a “Force Majeure Event”).
